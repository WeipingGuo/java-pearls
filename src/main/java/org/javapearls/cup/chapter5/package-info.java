/**
 * Bit operations:
 *
 * 	http://vipan.com/htdocs/bitwisehelp.html
 *
 *	Java's bitwise operators operate on individual bits of integer (int and long) values.
 *	If an operand is shorter than an int, it is promoted to int before doing the operations.
 *
 *	Binary Math:
 *
 *	Addition
 *	0 + 0 = 0
 *	0 + 1 = 1
 *	1 + 0 = 1
 *	1 + 1 = 0, and carry 1 to the next more significant bit
 *
 *	Subtraction:
 *	0 - 0 = 0
 *	0 - 1 = 1, and borrow 1 from the next more significant bit
 *	1 - 0 = 1
 *	1 - 1 = 0
 *
